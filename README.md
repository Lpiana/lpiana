## 🚀 What I do

I work at the intersection of **hardware, software and artificial intelligence**,
developing **end-to-end robotic and intelligent systems** — from sensors,
microcontrollers and real-time embedded systems to perception, control,
localization and high-level software.

My experience includes **RTOS-based embedded systems**, **ROS-based robotic
architectures**, computer vision pipelines and AI-driven decision-making
applied to real-world, industrial and autonomous systems.

My profile is strongly oriented toward **applied R&D**, robotics,
product development and scalable technical solutions.
